## Explaining Bank Customer Churn

### Description

One important metric that banks consider for assessing their lifetime value attributed to customers is whether or not a specific customer would stop being a customer. This is referred to generally as `churn` and is often modeled in a mathematical way. In this project, I pose `churn` for bank customers in a machine learning project which involves binary classification and the use of tree-based models such as Catboost and LightGBM for getting high quality predictions and being able to explain them using ideas in `XAI` such as `SHAP` and `permutation importance`. In order for stakeholders to get a bird's eye view into the insights of this project, I created a dashboard with all the important classification metrics, visualizations, `what-if` scenarios, and explainable AI concepts using a framework known as `ExplainerDashboard`.
